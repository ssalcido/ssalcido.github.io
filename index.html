            <p>
                After some time of working full time, while studying for a master’s and taking care of my family at the
                same time, I started to experiment mental fatigue. The coronavirus lockdown only made things worse; so,
                I decided to spend some time finding ways help my brain.
            </p>
            <p>
                I found an article that described mental fatigue like “the feeling that your brain just won’t function
                right. You can’t concentrate, even simple tasks take forever, and you find yourself rereading the same
                paragraph or tweaking the same line of code over-and-over again.” So I decided to put in practice
                different strategies from that <a href="https://blog.doist.com/mental-fatigue/" target="_blank">article</a> and also others from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-workout-for-your-mental-health-11610917200" target="_blank">this one</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this project, I chose practices that are easier to track. Basically: workout, meditation, water
                intake and learning to code. This project is partially inspired by the personal annual reports from
                <a href="http://feltron.com/index.html" target="_blank">Nicholas Felton</a>.

            <p>
                Work in front of a computer and being in lockdown is a recipe for getting in bad shape. Since gyms are
                closed, I found an online workout program that only requires a couple of dumbbells. It has five routines
                per week, with two days of pause: upper body, lower body, all body, cardio and active recovery.

                Pretty straightforward: Stay hydrated. “Studies show that even mild dehydration can negatively impact
                cognitive performance. Drink plenty of water – coffee doesn’t count.”

            <p>
                “You can’t cope with stress well if your brain is on high alert at all times.” I used to be skeptical
                about meditation practices but I found that it can be really pragmatic. It really helps me to regain
                contact with the present moment. Simple breathing exercises can make wonders with the right intention.

                        simply was too busy or simply forgot to follow them. It becomes more obvious as they work charge
                        increased.

                At first, adding more learning seems counterintuitive. But I considered it a “wisely chosen
                extracurricular activity.” Apparently, “pleasant activities, ones that give you a sense of purpose […],
                and ones that make you feel accomplished or masterful (such as learning a language) improve mental
                health.” So this was a no-brainer. I’m determined to learn to code, as challenging as it is, and found
                that gradual exercises work really well for me.

                        I’m just considering sessions where I was purposely on Code Academy. I had less time towards the
                        end of the course. While I spent a good amount of time learning how to code this page, I did not
                        consider that time in my database.
